# Factorio-Video-Mathematica
A code for turning a video/list of images/gif into a Factorio video in Wolfram Mathematica 11 using a blueprint strings mod.

Dropped project that I posted to github for a comparason to [DaveMcW's much more impressive and streamline version](https://github.com/DaveMcW/factorio-movie-maker)

the code can take in any file that can be turned into a series of binary images, and output two blueprint strings for the "video screen" and "video driver".

small tests @ 12x12 pixles and 10 frame loops ran @60fps
