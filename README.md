# Factorio-Video-Mathematica
A code for turning a video/list of images/gif into a Factorio video in Wolfram Mathematica 11 using a blueprint strings mod.

Dropped project that I posted to github for a comparason to [DaveMcW's much more impressive and streamline version](https://github.com/DaveMcW/factorio-movie-maker)
